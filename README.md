# Toll Calculator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Naeralys/toll-calculator.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Naeralys/toll-calculator)
A calculator for vehicle toll fees, based on an open technical assessment by [EvolveTechnology](https://github.com/EvolveTechnology/toll-calculator/).

Node/Typescript

## Background
Our city has decided to implement toll fees in order to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours.
This is the current draft of requirements:
 
* Fees will differ between 8 SEK and 18 SEK, depending on the time of day 
* Rush-hour traffic will render the highest fee
* The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK
* A vehicle should only be charged once an hour
  * In the case of multiple fees in the same hour period, the highest one applies.
* Some vehicle types are fee-free
* Weekends and holidays are fee-free

## Your assignment
The last city-developer quit recently, claiming that this solution is production-ready. 
You are now the new developer for our city - congratulations! 

Your job is to deliver the code and from now on, you are the responsible go-to-person for this solution. This is a solution you will have to put your name on.
